    <h2>making music literacy <em>fun</em>!</h2>

  <article class='text'>
    <p>
      This project's philosophy is in line with Music Matters by Dave Elliot and believes in the Kodaly method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music making gives us enjoyment, self growth and self knowledge. I believe that music education
      is part of a well rounded education and a fulfilling life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musicianship is a multidimensional form of knowledge that is practice-specific and seated within several
      contexts: global, historical, cultural, social, individual, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beeken hopes to deliver <strong>formal knowledge</strong> in a fun and accessible format.
      It also hopes to inspire curiosity and critical thinking from the viewer. At the same time,
      I hope to emphasize that music theory <strong>helps</strong> you interact with the world of music.
      It is not a secret code that is only available to gifted students, geniuses or prodigies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music making helps us get into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>
      state. You don't need to know anything about Western Music tradition or notation to experience this.
      On the other hand, it is helpful to have a formal understanding of your musical world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beeken hopes to ease the "fun gap" that exists between making music and learning about
      music theory using <strong>comedy, laughter and honesty</strong>.

      I'm a content creator. I love making jam packed educational videos that are exciting and fun.
      Laughter and enthusiasm are absolutely essential for learning.

      Originally from Salem, OR, I have always loved music and singing (evidenced by two over the shoulder piano shots.)

      I went to theater camp for the choir class but ended up contracting a love of theater and improv comedy too.
      It's so amazing what is possible with <u>just your body and your mind</u>!
      I studied music education at Northern Arizona University and landed a job teaching high school choir after graduating.
      Although I absolutely loved teaching, I found I could be so much more effective merging technology and education.
      So, I quit after just one year and took a day job as a web developer... and Mr. Beeken was born shortly after.
      Here I am today, trying as hard as I can to use the internet for good!
      Free education is so important to our world and the world deserves a great learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who have supported Mr.Beeken: from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much!
      You share my vision of free, high quality educational content for all and together we are making it happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, thank you so much! Stay excited and always be learning. The most important ingredients in life!
    </p>
    <p>
      With gratitude,
