    I'm a content creator. I love making jam packed educational videos that are exciting and fun.
    Laughter and enthusiasm are absolutely essential for learning.

    Originally from Salem, OR, I have always loved music and singing (evidenced by two over the shoulder piano shots.)

    I went to theater camp for the choir class but ended up contracting a love of theater and improv comedy too.
    It's so amazing what is possible with <u>just your body and your mind</u>!
    I studied music education at Northern Arizona University and landed a job teaching high school choir after graduating.
    Although I absolutely loved teaching, I found I could be so much more effective merging technology and education.
    So, I quit after just one year and took a day job as a web developer... and Mr. Beeken was born shortly after.
    Here I am today, trying as hard as I can to use the internet for good!
    Free education is so important to our world and the world deserves a great learning experience.

  <p>
    To those who have supported Mr.Beeken: from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much!
    You share my vision of free, high quality educational content for all and together we are making it happen!
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, thank you so much! Stay excited and always be learning. The most important ingredients in life!
  </p>
  <p>
    With gratitude,
